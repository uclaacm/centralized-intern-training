# Centralized Intern Training

 Across the eight different committees that make up ACM and Internal, web development skills is one of the most prominent shared skill used between all of them! More than just the committees that focus on web development (ACM’s dev team, TeachLA, and Hack), each committee will also need people to help manage their official website.
This year, instead of having each committee lead their interns individually on web dev skills, we’re going to have one big training plan that covers common skills, with sessions hosted by various ACM officers from different committees.

Here is a collection of each session's lesson plan for reference in the future!
