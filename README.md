# Centralized Intern Training

 Across the eight different committees that make up ACM, ACM Board and its initiatives, web development is one of the most prominent shared skill used between all of them! More than just the committees that focus on web development (ACMâ€™s dev team, TeachLA, and Hack), each committee will also need people to help manage their official website.

This year, we plan to have an asynchronous training program for all interns to learn the basics of web development and get hands-on experience with these technologies. Each week (except week 4) will have an assigned topic and a mandatory task to complete. 

If you feel like you already have a good grasp of the topic, feel free to skip ahead to the task. If you feel like you need more help, I would encourage you to discuss with your peers, and reach out to if you still need help.
