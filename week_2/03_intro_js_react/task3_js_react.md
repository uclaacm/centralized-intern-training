# Task: Create a Simple Blog with React.js

## Objective:
Develop a simple blog application using React.js that allows users to add, view, and like blog posts.

## Part 1: Setting Up and Basic JavaScript

### Setting up the Environment:

1. Install Node.js and a package manager (npm or Yarn).
2. Use create-react-app to initialize a new React project.
JavaScript Basics:
3. Create a simple JavaScript script that logs "Hello World" to the console.
4. Experiment with variables (let, var, and const), primitive types, and basic functions.

## Part 2: Building the Blog with React

### Creating Components:

Create a Blog component to display a list of blog posts.
Each blog post should be a separate Post component showing the post's title and content.

### State and Props:

Use state (useState) in the Blog component to hold an array of posts.
Pass each post as a prop to the Post components.

### Adding New Posts:

Implement a form to add new posts to the blog. This should update the state in the Blog component.

### Implementing Likes:

Add a 'Like' button to each Post component.
Use state to track and display the number of likes for each post.

## Part 3: Interactivity and Final Touches

### Adding Interactivity:

Ensure that clicking the 'Like' button updates the number of likes for the respective post.

### Styling the Application:

Styling the application is optional, but you can use CSS to make the application look nicer.

Test your application to ensure that adding posts and liking them works as expected.

## Deliverables:

- Source code for the simple blog application in a GitHub repository. Deploying the application on a service of your choice is preferred but not required.
- A README file documenting the structure of your project and instructions on how to run it.
