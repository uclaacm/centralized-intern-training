# Task: Enhance Your Blog Website with TypeScript and Advanced React Hooks

## Objective:
Refactor the personal blog website to use TypeScript for type safety and explore advanced React Hooks for efficient state management and component lifecycle handling.

### Part 1: Refactoring with TypeScript

1. Convert JavaScript to TypeScript:
   - Rename your .js files to .tsx (for files with JSX) or .ts (for others).
   - Introduce static typing to your components, state, and props.

2. Define TypeScript Interfaces:
   - Create interfaces for the props of your components.
   - Define the shape of your state objects.

3. Type Checking with TypeScript:
   - Use TypeScript to prevent type-related errors in your code.
   - Ensure all function arguments and return types are correctly typed.


### Part 2: Advanced React Hooks

1. Using useEffect for Lifecycle Events:
   - Implement useEffect to handle component mounting, updating, and unmounting.
   - Use it to control side effects like data fetching or subscriptions.

2. Global State Management with useContext:

   - Set up a global state using the Context API.
   - Replace prop drilling with useContext to pass down state and functions.

3. Navigating with React Router:

   - Implement React Router for navigating between different pages.
   - Use route parameters and links to pass data and navigate.


## Deliverables:
- Source code for the simple blog application in a GitHub repository. Deploying the application on a service of your choice is preferred but not required.
- A README file explaining the TypeScript integrations and usage of advanced React hooks in the project. Include instructions on how to run the project.
